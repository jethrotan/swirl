The Swirl project aims to deliver a fully functional implementation of the PPSP
protocol in a number of languages and frameworks.

The first implementation is being written in [Erlang/OTP], which is a functional
programming language combined with a robust set of application libraries
designed and tested for writing scalable and reliable telco and internet
services. Erlang is widely used in mission-critical applications today, from
military, financial, telecoms, medical, as well as internet-scale games,
databases, social networks, and messaging services.

## Approach

The chosen approach is to implement swirl in phases, and funding is being
provided generously by [NLNet] for the first stages:

1. a [decoder], taking internet / wire format to internal parsed format
2. an [encoder], performing the reverse step from internal format to the wire
3. [storage] layer comprising merkle tree, binmap lookups and key-value storage
4. simple [deployment] including FreeBSD and Linux/docker support

However, none of this can be implemented effectively, unless the overall
framework of the project is in place. Work on the decoder in particular became
blocked, as the simplistic approach used initially to manager the UDP port
handlers, got in the way of passing the appropriate swarm and peer information
through to the right package parsers.

This is in the process of being ripped out now, and as a bonus of this work, the
[supervision] tree (the OTP structure of applications including peers and
swarms) is being cleaned up in the [peer-supervisor] branch.

## Future Plans

Further phases are planned, currently:

1. live [streaming] support
2. [zeroconf] / MDNS support (also known as bonjour protocol) for identifying local peers
3. NAT [traversal] support, via STUN/TURN/ICE etc, depending on the outcome of
   the IETF standardisation process
4. [browser] support
5. [mobile] device support
6. [embedded] systems
